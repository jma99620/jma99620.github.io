		 <h2> The Interested Gentlemen of Lambda Theta Phi Invite You to:</h2>
		 <h1>Pi&#241ata & Chill</h1>
		 <p>
			Feeling stressed? Is the pressure of the upcoming finals week starting to catch up with you? 
			Well, look no further for a stress release because the Interested Gentlemen of Lambda Theta 
			Phi Latin Fraternity Inc. have the perfect one for UGA students! We invite all students to 
			join us in our mission to smash open an <q>indestructible</q> pi&#241ata right in Tate Plaza.</p> 
		 <p>
			What better way to blow off steam than by hitting something with all of your might, right?
			There&#39s even candy inside! So, if you&#39re the lucky hitter that breaks the pi&#241ata open, 
			you get an advantage to collecting as much candy as possible! You can even save that candy
			for any stress eating induced by finals week! How convenient would that be?
			See if you can prove your strength in front of your fellow students and possibly be rewarded for it!</p>
		 <p>
			Need a better incentive for participating? We&#39ll be offering students hot chocolate for just a dollar
			so that you can brave the winter cold with the warm satisfaction of this classic beverage.</p>
